# Bingle : Front-End

<!-- ![Copy of devating-logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56938630/75009422-803e8b00-542f-11ea-89fd-63a879dd9177.png)

## Project Overview

Bootcamps have been steadily popular since 2012 and these programs graduated more than 33,900 students in 2019 alone. However, there is no strong community where bootcamp students can showcase their work, build strong relationships with others in their bootcamps or even other bootcamps. Therefore, I decided to build a mobile app where current bootcamp students and grads showcase their works, become influencers, build stronger communities, and get contacted by recruiters.
