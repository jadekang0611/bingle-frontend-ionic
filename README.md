## Project Overview

Bootcamps have been steadily popular since 2012 and these programs graduated more than 33,900 students in 2019 alone. However, there is no strong community where bootcamp students can showcase their work, build strong relationships with others in their bootcamps or even other bootcamps. Therefore, I decided to build a mobile app where current bootcamp students and grads showcase their works, become influencers, build stronger communities, and get contacted by recruiters.

## User Stories:

**Our Users:**

- Age: 20 - 30
- Current bootcamp students & graduates studying web development, software engineering, UI/UX Design

**Why are they using our app?**

- To build and maintain relationships with many bootcamp students and graduates to be inspired and inspire through their careers and portfolios.


**What are they doing in our app? What is their main activity?**
